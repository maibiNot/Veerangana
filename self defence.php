    </br>
As women, our self-defense training consisted of having been taught not to hit or fight back. That someone else will protect us. Unfortunately, the statistics show that the “someone else” usually turns out to be our attacker/abuser.
</br>
We face multiple challenges and obstacles as women when seeking self-defence and personal safety training. The largest obstacle for most women is finding a competent, quality, no testosterone is filled, training site with skilled, competent, easy going professional women's self-defense trainers who understand the challenges we face as women and what we will, and won’t do, in our defense. And most importantly, who can make us laugh and relax while still tackling a serious subject.
</br>
That’s where Women’s Self-Defense Institute excels. We present information in clear, concise training formats so you can easily walk out of class and immediately implement the self-defense training strategies you’ve learned.
</br>
Most people believe it takes years to learn effective women's self-defense. Well, it doesn’t. We highly encourage all the women out there to practice self defence and stand for themselves as a worrier and fight against the evil.
</br>
here our main goal is to provide you the best videos of self defence all at a one place for your convience you don't need to mug up with plenty of sites and tutorials, and also tips for how to recognize pre-conflict indicators and to be aware of post-conflict dangers. We provide you with the tools to handle these situations.
</br>
 Basically, everyone: single women, college-students, housewives, business professionals, mothers, black belts, police, military personnel, travelers, survivors of crime, nurses, high school & middle school girls, girls scouts, soccer players, churchgoers must need to follow these tips and aware about the need of self defence.
