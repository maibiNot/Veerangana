        <p> One day I was returning quite late from my office. The roads were deserted and I was feeling very unsafe. Out of the blue, I registered on Veerangana and asked for  a transport so that I could go back home. Surprisingly, within 5 minutes, an auto was sent which real time tracker that tracked my GPS location at each and every point of time. More over, the driver suggested me to video call any one  of my family member. In no time, I reached my home safely. Thank you Veerangana!</p>
